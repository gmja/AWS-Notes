			* CloudGuru
	* Spent a good early chunk sitting through lectures on all of the AWS services offered
		* Boring but offered a great "overhead view" of all of the services offered in a datacenter
		* Felt like it fast tracked me on learning a lot of services that happen to make a datacenter work
	* Jumped into Identity Access Management Lab and Lectures
		* Creating accounts, setting permissions, modifying settings, etc.
	* Followed by MASSIVE S3 series
		* Many lectures, many labs
		* Discussed and used different types of storage (flat vs block)
			* Changed different types of storage options such as s3 to glacier
		* Set policies regarding storage length, permissions, and policies on what to do with old 	 infomration
		* Discuessed various large data transfer methods including snowball and snowmobile
		* CloudFront and how data reacts to actions in one location when it's modified in another
		* Storage Gateway, Security and Encryption Lectures
	* Followed up by EC2 Section
		* Various labs and lectures

		* How to access them via PUTTY
		* Setting Security groups in EC2
		* Volumes and snapshots
		* EC2 Load Balancing
		* Cloud Watch for EC2
		* AWS Command Line Interface
			* Lecture followed up by serveral labs
			* Gave me some serious trouble
			* Going to have to go back later and go over it again with assistance from Dr. Yu's book suggestion

* Wasn't able to finish the entire CloudGuru Course
	* The sections I did finish made up a very large swath of the course. The remaining sections cover a lot of the other offerings from AWS but should be very quick to fly through. I hope to take the AWS Certification sometime this summer.
